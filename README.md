Just a collection of projects I worked on.
Developed a range of self-directed projects that reflect my interests in machine learning, data visualization, and game development.

Machine Learning Models: Implemented several ML models for tasks such as malware detection, image classification, and regression. Leveraged Python libraries like Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Pandas to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate performance. Focused on practical applications, accuracy optimization, and clean, modular code.

Data Visualization: Created engaging visualizations to explore and communicate insights from real-world datasets. Projects includeveld dashboards and statistical plots using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly, emphasizing clarity, interactivity, and data storytelling.

Game Development: Designed and built multiple 2D games, including an Alien Invasion shooter,and a complimentary target practice game using Python and Pygame. Projects focused on core programming concepts such as object-oriented design, event handling, collision detection, and real-time user interaction.
